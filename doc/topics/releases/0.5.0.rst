========================
:program:`salt-ui` 0.5.0
========================

The Salt team is pleased to announce the 0.5.0 release of salt-ui.

For those unfamiliar with Salt's versioning patterns, the 0.5.0 initial release
is minimally functional and should be considered pre-alpha at best. The intent
of this release is to provide a functional baseline and to start a conversation
about the project.

:program:`salt-ui` in concept
=============================

:program:`salt-ui` is a rich, JavaScript-only interface that communicates with
Salt by making calls through :program:`salt-api`.

Participation
=============

:program:`salt-ui` is just getting off the ground so feedback, questions, and
ideas are critical as we solidify the full scope of the project. Please get
involved by `filing issues`__ on GitHub, `discussing on the mailing list`__,
and chatting in ``#salt``  or ``#salt-devel`` on Freenode.
